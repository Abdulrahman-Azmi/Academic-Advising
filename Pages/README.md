# Project: Academic Advising
Have you ever had problems with signing up for class? relationships, and other heavy responsibilities, the last thing you want to think about are your potential classes for next semester. Even though it may be a pain sometimes, academic advising is the key to success at W.I.S.E.


We give you "Academic Advising System" a web application developed by students, for students! Academic Advising System allows you to quickly and seamlessly view your course history and gives advisors the tools they need to properly plan a successful path for their students. Advisors should be a guide to help students throughout their career in college, and Academic Advising System gives them the right means to do just that.
